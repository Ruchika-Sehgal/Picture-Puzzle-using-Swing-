# Picture-Puzzle-using-Swing

//This project accepts a square piece of image and converts it into a 3*3 puzzle piece. These puzzle pieces are then arranged in a random order and provided to the users. The reset button at the botton rearranges the puzzle pieces. The New Game button at the top is used to refresh both the image as well as the puzzle pieces.
